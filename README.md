# Country-Religion-Classifier
Classifier to correctly identify the religion of a country given its geographical location, its area in square kilometers, its population in millions of people, its language and the characteristics of its flag such as its color and the shapes that appear on it like: circles, crosses, sunstars, crescents, saltires, triangles, etc... For this task, I used the *flags* dataset from the repository of Machine Learning of the University of California Irvine (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/40/flags) which contains information of 194 countries.

Throughout the project you will be able to find:

* Data cleaning and standardization.
* Descriptive Statistics on predictors to identify outliers.
* Selection of the most influential predictors for correctly classifying a country's religion.
* Creation of Pipelines to test different classification models and find the best classifier.
